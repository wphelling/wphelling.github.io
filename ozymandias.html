<h1>OZYMANDIAS</h1>
<h2>Percy Bysshe Shelley</h2>

<p>
I met a traveller from an antique land<br>
Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br>
Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,<br>
Half sunk, a shatter'd visage lies, whose frown<br>
And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command<br>
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br>
Which yet survive, stamp'd on these lifeless things,<br>
The hand that mock'd them and the heart that fed.<br>
And on the pedestal these words appear:<br>
"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:<br>
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"<br>
Nothing beside remains: round the decay<br>
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,<br>
The lone and level sands stretch far away.
